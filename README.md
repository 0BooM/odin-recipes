# odin-recipes

This is the first Odin Project that I'm doing, it is a site with recipes.

I made a website with 3 recipes using some basics of CSS like borders, border-radius, colors, fonts etc.
In this project I also learned how to make links to another websites, add and style images and also text.
I also used unordered and ordered lists to make the site look better.
